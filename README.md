# Fast Bachelor Project

## Notebooks:
    If not used in Kaggle, change the following part of the code for creating a session:
      
        aws_access_key_id=user_secrets.get_secret("access_key"),
        aws_secret_access_key=user_secrets.get_secret("secret_access_key"),
        
  ## Server:      
        
   The server should be started with the command `node server.js`.
   View the content of the channel with the provided [videoplayer](https://github.com/georgvimond/videoplayer), or any online player capable of HLS playback with the source `http://localhost:8080/channels/channel/master.m3u8`.

## Short video showing the results
Note that since the assets contain randomized video content, their titles are not indicative of their actual content.
